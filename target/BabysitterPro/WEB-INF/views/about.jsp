		<h1>Why we are Unique.</h1>
	</div>

	<ul>
		<p>Finding a babysitter at the last minute is usually the most
			stressful type of childcare booking for parents. Whether its due to a
			long-standing babysitting arrangement falling through, a late-running
			meeting or the offer of last-minute gig tickets, no parent wants to
			feel that they're booking good enough childcare. Whats more, by the
			time they've contacted all the options in their address book, it may
			well be too late.</p>

		<li><h3>Last-minute doesn't have to mean compromising on
				peace of mind</h3>
			<p>Babysitter has been designed so that parents can post a job
				and find vetted, trusted sitters in their area as quickly as
				possible. Even with a day or just a couple of hours to find a
				sitter, the hard work's already been done. All Babysitter sitters
				have completed an extensive verification process, submitting
				passport/ID documents along with two references and undergo an
				online background check. As part of registration, each sitter must
				integrate their Babysitter account with their Facebook account and
				verify their mobile phone number.</p></li>

		<li><h3>Secure instant access to your neighbourhood's top
				sitters</h3>
			<p>With only 15 per cent of applicants being approved, parents
				can be assured that the sitters on the app are already the best in
				their area.</p></li>

		<li>
			<h3>There's no need to spend hours messaging calling every
				sitter you know</h3>
			<p>With Babysitter, you can notify multiple trusted sitters with
				the tap of an app. Once a parent has posted a request, all available
				local sitters instantly receive a notification and can respond
				straight away. Parents have found Babysitter sitters at 6 am to help
				out when they had vital work commitments and their child was off
				school sick, another was invited to key work drinks at the end of
				the day and was able to find a sitter in minutes to meet them at
				home for a handover so they could change and return to the event.</p>
		</li>

		<li><h3>Find a sitter who's right for your family</h3>
			<p>Its still possible to find the right fit for each family even
				when time is short. Its clear to see on Babysitter sitters profiles
				if they have their own car and experience with babies or children
				with SEN. Many Babysitter sitters now have video profiles, helping
				parents select the right sitter for them and adding another layer of
				reassurance.</p></li>

		<li><h3>Complete clarity about qualifications</h3>
			<p>If parents would like a sitter with a DBS check, they can
				easily see if the sitter has one and if its been verified by the
				Babysitter team by checking for the badge on their profile.</p></li>
		<li><h3>Build a support squad you already know and trust</h3>
			<p>A last-minute sitter doesn't have to be a new face. Parents
				who use Babysitter on a regular basis will have had the opportunity
				to book and get to know lots of great sitters in their area. Many of
				our parents book a Babysitter sitter to entertain the children while
				they're working from home, doing a workout in the living room or
				sorting out life admin. Some call in a sitter to help with the
				hectic hours before bedtime or choose a sitter with teaching
				experience who can help out with homework. The ability to select
				from a pool of trusted sitters means that when it comes to a
				last-minute job, regular Babysitter users will already have a small
				army of help at hand, and can contact all their favourite sitters in
				seconds by posting a job in the app.</p></li>
